In this approach we replace the controller's empty function body with an implementation found through genetic programming. Additionally, we introduce a ServerModel, which keeps a state if required. One may access the state using CRUD operations. \n",

    "Concretely, the view function of an REST endpoint is patched to run a new controller function other than the default controller. While the openapi generator keeps controller nicely separated from the Connexion / Flask framework, it wraps them when loading the openapi spec. Basically, it applies various Python [decorators within the Operation object](https://github.com/zalando/connexion/blob/bed4b95205205861bd6014282d0f61d50231d3ac/connexion/operations/abstract.py#L340) around the controller function to add additional behavior. Note, [do not confuse it with the decorator pattern](https://wiki.python.org/moin/DecoratorPattern). As a consequence, the monkey patching approach has to unwrap the enpoint's view function at first to re-gain access to the (default) controller function. Afterwards, it replaces the code. "
